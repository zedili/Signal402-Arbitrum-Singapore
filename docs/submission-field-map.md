# HackQuest final submission field map

This map is based on the current Signal402 project setup page, HackQuest's
official participant submission guides, and the Singapore event requirements.
The exact final form may change when the submission window opens, so re-read
every field before entering or submitting data.

## Submission flow

1. Open **My Buildathon** and select the registered Singapore event.
2. Choose **Start Submission**.
3. Select the existing 100/100-ready Signal402 project.
4. Complete event-specific fields and deployment details.
5. Review all public claims and confidential judge-only information.
6. Obtain owner confirmation immediately before accepting terms or clicking the
   final submit button.
7. Save the success message, submitted-project URL, submission identifier if
   present, and a timestamped screenshot.
8. Re-open the submitted project from My Buildathon and verify that it appears
   in the Singapore Project Gallery.

HackQuest documentation says submitted projects may normally be edited before
the deadline, but do not rely on that as a recovery strategy.

## Pre-window public-field correction

The live HackQuest project page was audited on Aug 31, 2026. Its original
**Progress During Hackathon** field described pre-event functionality as though
it were already completed during the event. After explicit owner confirmation,
the field was corrected and publicly verified on Sep 7, 2026 with this truthful
interim text:

> Pre-event baseline recorded on Aug 31, 2026; none of the items below are
> claimed as Buildathon-period work. Signal402 already has a live Polymarket
> data experience, a server-side structured AI report, an x402 v2 test-USDC
> payment flow on Arbitrum Sepolia, fail-closed settlement tests, a deployed
> hash-attestation registry, CI, videos, and a production deployment. Substantive
> Buildathon development has not started. Work completed from Sep 14 onward will
> be recorded separately in a commit-linked changelog and this field will be
> replaced with verified in-window progress before final submission.

The saved public page continued to show `100 Ready To Submit`. Replace this
interim text only with verified, commit-linked work completed during the
official window.

## HackQuest acknowledgment placement

The public Team tab labels the entry **Solo Project** and lists only
`qwe962456`. That formal team state was left unchanged. To honor the owner's
request without implying that historical contributors are current entrants,
the following text was appended to the public project description and verified
on Sep 7, 2026:

> Signal402 builds on the earlier X402AiPolyMarket prototype. We thank the early
> project-team contributors whose work is preserved in the imported baseline
> and the original repository history,
> including `wuyangfan`, `123skkda`, and `zhaohaisen`. They contributed to the
> pre-event foundation and are not members of this solo Buildathon entry.

This is the appropriate placement because HackQuest's Team tab represents
formal current membership, while the Description can accurately distinguish
historical contribution from the present entry.

## Current portal state

Observed again on Sep 7, 2026 while signed in as the owner:

- Project readiness is `100 Ready To Submit`.
- The public Description contains the historical-contributor acknowledgment.
- The public Progress field contains the pre-event baseline disclosure and says
  substantive Buildathon development has not started.
- The Team tab says `Solo Project` and contains only `qwe962456`.
- The Buildathon tab's `Submitted Buildathons` list is empty, as expected before
  the submission window opens and the final submit action is completed.
- Registration on the Singapore event page remains `Registered`.

## Event-specific fields to resolve

### Location

HackQuest guides show a participant location field in some final submission
forms. Do not infer or publish the owner's city or country. Ask for the exact
public location value if the Singapore form requires it.

### Prize track

The event lists Overall Prize, Best/Promising Products, and discretionary
grants. If multiple selection is allowed, select every honest eligible track.
If only one track is allowed, ask the owner to choose after comparing the final
form wording and milestone obligations. The Promising Products track appears to
be exempt from the staged 25%/25%/50% prize conditions described for other
categories, which may materially affect the choice.

Use `docs/prize-track-decision.md` for the verified amounts, tradeoffs,
recommended selection rule, and exact owner-confirmation gates.

Do not select a Robinhood Chain track or claim a Robinhood deployment unless a
real, tested deployment is completed and the owner has approved that strategy.

### Terms and eligibility declarations

Immediately before submission, obtain explicit owner confirmation of:

- age 18 or older;
- no sanctions or legal restriction preventing participation;
- no excluded relationship with organizers, sponsors, or judges;
- authority and rights to submit all code, media, and third-party assets;
- acceptance of the official IP, publicity, data-sharing, confidentiality,
  dispute, compliance, tax, and prize/grant conditions;
- the accuracy of the connected payout wallet;
- the final public submission text and AI-assistance disclosure.

### Confidential deployment details

HackQuest marks deployment details as judge-only. Enter only the ecosystem,
testnet/mainnet status, canonical address, and explorer link. Never put a private
key, seed phrase, API key, RPC credential, wallet recovery detail, or production
secret into the form.

## Final verification evidence

Save all of the following under a timestamped local evidence directory:

- screenshot of the reviewed final form before submission;
- screenshot of the successful submission message;
- submitted project URL and any submission ID;
- Project Gallery listing;
- exact Git commit and public pre-event tag;
- production deployment URL and deployment identifier;
- in-window x402 settlement and registry attestation receipts;
- final copies or hashes of the demo and pitch videos;
- organizer clarification on deadline and existing-project eligibility.
